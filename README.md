# data_collection_mars
This is the Module 11 Challenge on Data Collection

This involved a number of skills learned during the module, namely web-scraping. I can now see different elements and attributes on an HTML page, and use Splinter, Beautiful Soup for extracting and parsing data.

For analysis there were a number of questions posed by the challenge to draw on the basics of pandas methods and matplotlib to both organize and visualize data within a DataFrame.
